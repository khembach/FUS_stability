# Analysis of mRNA stability after actinomycin D treatment

This repository contains the code for the analysis of the actinomycin D treatment RNA-seq experiment. Samples from WT and FUS-KI mice were treated with actinomycin D and poly-A RNA-seq was performed at 4 time points: 0h, 8h, 12h and 24h.
We used ARMOR to perform a differential gene expression analysis at each time point comparing FUS-KI to WT. The results are further analyzed with R. This includes GO analysis, hierarchical clustering and comparison of FUS peak locations.

The rmarkdown documents can be found in directory Rmd/.
